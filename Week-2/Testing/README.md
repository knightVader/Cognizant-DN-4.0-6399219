# Testing Folder Overview

This folder demonstrates a complete setup and usage of unit testing in Java using JUnit (both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5), Mockito for mocking, and SLF4J for logging, all managed with Maven. It is structured as a Maven project and contains both source code and test code, as well as build artifacts. This project is ideal for learning and reference purposes for anyone interested in Java testing best practices.

## Folder Structure and Contents

- **JUnitSetup/**: Main Maven project for demonstrating unit testing concepts.
  - **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file. It defines:
    - Project metadata (groupId, artifactId, version)
    - Java version compatibility
    - Dependencies for JUnit 4, JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5), Mockito, and SLF4J
    - Build plugins and settings
    - This file is essential for managing dependencies and automating builds/tests.
  - **src/main/java/**: Contains the main application source code.
    - `Calculator.java`: Implements basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Used to demonstrate unit testing of business logic.
    - `com/example/ExternalApi.java`: An interface representing an external API. Used to show how to mock dependencies in tests.
    - `com/example/MyService.java`: A service class that depends on `ExternalApi`. Demonstrates dependency injection and how to test classes with external dependencies.
    - `com/example/LoggingExample.java`: Shows how to use SLF4J for logging in Java applications. Demonstrates best practices for logging errors and warnings.
  - **src/test/java/**: Contains unit tests for the main source code.
    - `CalculatorTest.java`: JUnit 4 test class for `Calculator`. Covers all arithmetic operations, demonstrates the use of `@Before` and `@After` for setup/teardown, and shows how to write clear, isolated unit tests.
    - `AssertionsTest.java`: Demonstrates various JUnit assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, `assertNull`, `assertNotNull`). Useful for learning how to validate different conditions in tests.
    - `com/example/MyServiceTest.java`: JUnit 5 test class using Mockito to mock `ExternalApi` and verify interactions with `MyService`. Shows how to use `@Test`, `Mockito.mock`, `when`, and `verify` for effective unit testing with mocks.
  - **target/**: Maven build output directory.
    - Contains compiled classes, test classes, and the generated JAR file (`junit-setup-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`).
    - Subfolders for Maven build status, generated sources, and test results. These are automatically managed by Maven and are not meant to be edited manually.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Maven Project Structure
- Follows the standard Maven layout: separates source code (`src/main/java`) from test code (`src/test/java`).
- `pom.xml` manages dependencies, plugins, and build lifecycle.
- Build artifacts are placed in the `target` directory.

### 2. JUnit Testing
- **JUnit 4**: Used in `CalculatorTest.java` and `AssertionsTest.java`. Demonstrates classic unit testing with annotations like `@Test`, `@Before`, and `@After`.
- **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)**: Used in `MyServiceTest.java`. Shows modern testing features and integration with Mockito.
- **Assertions**: Demonstrates a variety of assertions to check expected outcomes.
- **Test Organization**: Shows how to structure tests for clarity and maintainability.

### 3. Mockito
- Used to create mock objects for dependencies (`ExternalApi`).
- Demonstrates how to stub method calls (`when(...).thenReturn(...)`) and verify interactions (`verify(...)`).
- Helps in isolating the unit under test and avoiding reliance on real external systems.

### 4. Logging with SLF4J
- `LoggingExample.java` shows how to use SLF4J for logging errors and warnings.
- Demonstrates best practices for logging in Java applications.

### 5. Build Artifacts
- Explains the contents of the `target` directory: compiled classes, test classes, and the JAR file.
- Shows how Maven automates the build and test process.

## How to Use This Project

### 1. Build the Project
- Open a terminal in the `JUnitSetup` directory.
- Run the following command to clean, compile, and test the project:
  ```sh
  mvn clean install
  ```
- This will compile the code, run all tests, and create a JAR file in the `target` directory.

### 2. Explore the Code
- Review the source files in `src/main/java` to understand the application logic.
- Review the test files in `src/test/java` to see how unit tests and mocks are implemented.

### 3. Run Tests
- Tests are automatically run during the Maven build process.
- To run tests separately, use:
  ```sh
  mvn test
  ```
- Test reports and results are available in the `target` directory.

### 4. Logging
- Run the `LoggingExample` class to see SLF4J logging in action. You can modify the logger configuration as needed.

## Real-World Applications
- This project structure and approach are widely used in professional Java development.
- Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito is a best practice for ensuring code quality and reliability.
- Maven simplifies dependency management and build automation.
- Logging is essential for monitoring and debugging applications in production.
